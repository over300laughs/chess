Assignment Description:

savedgame.xml contains the xml for an actual game that I played last week. The only difference is that I
moved it back one turn. See if you can find the winning move. Its black's turn. This data would corralate very well
with my chess program. The location of each peiece is recorded as well as the color and type of the piece.
I chose to use more attributes rather than tags to add additional information, although it can be done either way.
As an additional attribution, the code that was provided was used but with some tweaks to add additional information
as well as more relevant tag names.

Assignment Location Details:
You can view the parsed data in a browser by launching index.html.
The parsed data is near the top under the title "XML Data".
The javascript code is all in the function named getGameInfo().
The function is located in assn5.js on line 8 and continues to line 47.
