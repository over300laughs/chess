				<strong>Required Objects</strong>
			</h2>
			<hr>
			<h2>
				Game Object
			</h2>
				<h3><strong>Functions-</strong></h3><br>
				<p class="more-para">init();<br>
					This function propagates the board to start the game.<br>
					highlight();<br>
					Highlights selected piece<br>
					getPeiceType();<br>
					Identifies what piece it is. 
				</p><br>
				<h3><strong>Properties</strong></h3>
				<br>
				<p class="more-para">
					stepBack[] - this is an array that holds info from the last move.
					This info may include objects, other arrays as well as integers and booleans. 
					Accessing this array will allow the user to hit back if they moved a piece unintentionally.
					Note: This function only steps back one step and is additional feature that may or may not be built
					depending on complexity. However, I'd like to see it in the game if I can get to work.
					<br>

			<h2 class="center-this-header">The Model Description</h2>
			<hr>
			<ul class="more-p">
				<li>
					The user clicks the Play Button
				</li>
				<li>
					The game object asks each player for a name. Names will displayed to show who's turn it is.
				</li>
				<li>
					A loop (most likely foreach) will place all the pieces in their appropriate location to start.
				</li>
				<li>
					When a piece is selected the appropriate moves are displayed.
				</li>
				<li>
					When an optional move is clicked the piece object remembers its new location
				</li>
				<li>
					The piece object then informs the game object
				</li>
				<li>
					The game object will tell the board object and the pieces to switch sides allowing the same view for both players.
					Each player object will run through a loop (most likely foreach) to propagate the switch.
				</li>
				<li>
					When a piece is taken it is marked as taken and is removed from the array of piece objects held by the player object.
					Can use CSS or actually delete object from the array.
				</li>
				<li>
					Subsequent moves continue until the finished button is selected.
				</li>
				<li>
					The game object then asks if the users want to play another game or quit.
				</li>
				<li>
					The game object will reset the game as indicated or simply leave the page with the completed game in tact.
				</li>
			</ul>
