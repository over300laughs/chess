					<h2>Instructions To Try Out The Game</h2>
					<p>
						To test these functions simply click on a pawn.<br>
						The piece and its possible moves will be highlighted.<br>
						After the first piece is moved then you will be able to click on a black pawn and move it.<br>
						The game cannot yet enforce who's turn it is, nor are any pieces ready to be moved except for pawns.<br>
						But basically highlight and moving functionality has been built.<br>
						Many of the functions to do this will be resused when it comes to moving other pieces as well.<br>
						Its important to note that the pawns can't move diagonally yet.
